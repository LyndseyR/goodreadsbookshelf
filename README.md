## GoodRead My Books Page

### Goodread Background
Launched in 2007, their mission is to help people find and share books they love. Really value the friendship feel, using the opinion of people you know to build your book list.

### STOW
##### Strengths
Their site has good information.
##### Threats
Overly cluttered
##### Opportunities
Get more people to share. Since friendship recommendations are big, there should be a tab easily connecting your friends mybook page. You could get notifications when they update a book they've reviewed.
##### Weaknesses
There's a lot of cluttered information. Site laid out in an outdated unbalanced way. Like the community page, it's ranked by the time of the post, no organization into how the topics are sorted. Too many options on the side navigation in mybook page. Don't really see need for 'Most read author' can see this by the sort option. Or the stat, API tab, find duplicates, widgets tabs.
Can only delete one book at a time from your bookshelf. And the page has 2 search bars. All of these things create the clutter.

### Project Overview
The goal of the site to get people excited to read, to give them an idea of what to read next. This is done through using recommendations. They've found that people trust their friends recommendations the most. Which leads me to redoing the mybook page and incorporating an easy access for people to be updated in what their friends have just reviewed. Not just displaying this information on the home page, but taking a step further and having a way to display notifications on the mybook page.
Also plan on getting rid of a lot of the database tools that I feel most people reading don't utilize.
Simplifying the search having just one search bar.

### Project Drivers
The goal of the project is to make it easier for users to see when their friends review a book.
